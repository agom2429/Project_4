For our final project we decided to focus on Student Mental Health specifically on Depression.
The mental illnesses in our data set were; Anxiety, Panic Attack, and depression. 
There was 10 columns and 100 rows of it. 
For our overall project we decided to predict whether the mentall illness depression had an affect on students gpa.

Our Data Model Implementation was through SQL.

Here are some examples on how we added the data:

For Visualtion section of our project we did some bar graphs
Nathan: 
The first graph explores the relationship between depression and treatment, showing that people who answered that they experienced receiving treatment all said they had experienced depression, while those not receiving treatment were split. The second graph focuses on the predicted probabilities of depression across different age groups, considering the treatment status. Those in the 25 & 30 age groups were more likely to receive treatment, while those in the other age groups were less likely to.
The final two visualizations show the difference in GPA between all students and students with depression.
Here are the visuals:
